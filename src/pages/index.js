      <em>Hello!</em>&nbsp;
      My name is Nick Reid
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm a PhD candidate in <a href="http://bime.uw.edu/">
        Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education
      </a> at the University of Washington.
      My advisor is Andrea Hartzler.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research focuses on how support is provided to people navigating chronic health conditions.
      I advocate for more accessible health information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from health information systems,
      I enjoy bicycles and
      napping in a hammock.
