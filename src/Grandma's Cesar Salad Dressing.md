Lasts about a week in the fridge

For about 8 people:
- 1 large head Romaine 
- croutons – preferably caeser salad ones 
- olive oil – 1/2 cup 
- lemon juice – 4 large Tbs 
- anchovy paste or real anchovies – approx 4 anchovies (2 inches ofpaste = 1 anchovy) 
- garlic – 2 Tbs minced from jar (fresh = stronger) 
- Romano or Parmesan cheese – shredded or grated (shredded = better): at least 1/2 cup 

My addition: 
- A tiny bit of sugar (to take the edge off the acidity) 
- A tiny dash of vinegar 
- Blend the anchovies with the garlic to make a paste. 
- Best if the dressing has a couple of hours to sit in the fridge and mellow.
