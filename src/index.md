# _Hey_  I'm Nick Reid

I'm a PhD candidate in [Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education](http://bime.uw.edu/)  at the University of Washington and am advised by [Andrea Hartzler.](https://bime.uw.edu/faculty/andrea-hartzler/) 

I research how people navigate chronic health conditions and advocate for more accessible health information. My dissertation describes the social and technical infrastructres that support people living with cystic fibrosis incorporate new care practices and treatments into their lives.

Beyond health informatics, I enjoy bicycles, [[Recipies|cooking,]] and naps.
