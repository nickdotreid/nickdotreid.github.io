# _Hi!_  I'm Nick Reid

I'm a PhD candidate in [Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education](http://bime.uw.edu/)  at the University of Washington and advised by Andrea Hartzler.

I research how people navigate chronic health conditions and advocate for more accessible health information.

Beyond health informatics, I enjoy bicycles, hammocks, and naps.
