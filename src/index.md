# _Hi!_  I'm Nick Reid

I'm a PhD candidate in [Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education](http://bime.uw.edu/)  at the University of Washington and advised by [Andrea Hartzler.](https://bime.uw.edu/faculty/andrea-hartzler/) My dissertation aims to describe the social and technical infrastructres that support people living with cystic fibrosis incorporate new care practices and treatments into their lives.

I research how people navigate chronic health conditions and advocate for more accessible health information.

Beyond health informatics, I enjoy bicycles, cooking, and naps.
